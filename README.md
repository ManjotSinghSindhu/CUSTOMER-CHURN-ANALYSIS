# CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS-FOR-A-TELECOMMUNICATION-COMPANY

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main contribution is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn.

The challenge is to design a model that will be able to predict whether a customer will stay or leave the company.
